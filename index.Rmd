## How to use this presentation

There are eight steps to the process, each is illustrated by a drawing. Use 
them to work with a group to define an actionable backlog of strategic items.

<br>

##### Navigate in these four ways:
1. If you go *horisonally* to the right you will see the eight steps in sequence.
2. If you go *down* on any step you will find a written instruction and,
3. if you hit *'esc'* you will see a navigational view of all the slides.
4. If you press *'s'* anywhere you come to the presenter's window.


***

## Where should you do the work?
- Steps 1-3 are very analytical and are best done in a working 
environment away from the office.
- Steps 4-6 are more visionary and free-flowing, they are best done in a 
different environment. Try something like a park, art museum or on a boat.
- Steps 7-8 are administrative and can be done at the office.

## Step 1: 
##### Open your mind and clear out prejudices

***

## Step1: The "spew-out"

<small>
In any workshop, the first step is to clear everyones mind of prejudices
and focus on the matters at hand. The spew-out is an excellent way of getting
all existing ideas out and "park" them for future use.

<br>

#### The steps in the spew-out
1. All participants prepare post-it notes individually for 15-30 min.
2. En turn, each participant read out the notes and stick them to board.
3. The facilitator helps the group through a dialogue on the results, finishing
by dot voting.
4. The facilitator holds a retrospective over the exercise.

<br>

##### All thoughts and ideas in this step will be used in step three, for the SPOT analysis according to this key: 

- Happening and Should happen = Strength,
- Happening and Shouldn't happen = Problems, to be investigated further 
by using Goldratt's [current reality tree](
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Current_reality_tree_\(Theory_of_constraints\)
), 
- Isn't happening and Should happen = Problems, 
- Isn't happening and Shouldn't happen = Strengths.

***

## Step 2: The Structure
<small>
##### The steps to share and define the structure
1. Divide the group according to market.
2. Have each group prepare a tree for their market.
3. Each market present their findings.
4. A facilitated dialogue to find common observations.
5. A facilitated retrospective over the exercise.

<br>

##### Parts of the trees
- The fruits in each tree are the customer benefits.
- The benefits hang on product branches.
- The brances are fixed to the main trunk of a core idea.
- The trunk is held in place by root technologies.
- The root system is kept alive by core competencies.

## Step 3: 
##### Transform everything to opportunities

<img height="400" src="assets/img/slide3.jpg">

***
## Step 3: SPOT analysis
The goal of the SPOT analysis is to create a list of opportunities. This list
can then be treated as a strategic backlog

<small>
##### The steps to the SPOT process
1. Populate the board with the observations from the 'spew-out' and 
'structure trees'.
2. Have each participants come up with post-it notes for quadrants on the board
that have fewer than average observations.
3. Populate the board so that it becomes relatively balanced.
4. Facilitated group-exercise to organize the post-its in order of falling 
priority by pair-wise comparison.
5. Facilitated dialogue on identified opportunities.
6. Facilitated retrospective over the work done in  the SPOT analysis.

## Step 4: 
##### See it in the right context

***

## Step 4: The context
<small>
Creating the context for strategic initiatives. This is done through dialogue 
and reflection in a harmonious atmospere. Get out of the office and maybe take a 
long stroll in nature. Notes can be kept on paper or in a common Google Sheet 
via mobile phones.

<br>

##### Hindsight - what we should have done differently
- Think back over what happened during the last period, and the periods before. 
- What made you scratch your head and ask, how did this happen?
- What made the sun come out? What did you solve or see more clearly?

<br>

##### Outsight - what the competition is doing
- What is happening in the industry?
- What are your knowledge and guesses about competitor's plans?
- Are their any technological or legal changes happening?
